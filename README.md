# node_first_app
----------------

We'll build a very simple user management app. With no UI other than the API endpoints we'll design in a RESTfull manner and the data stored locally as a .json file with read/write functionalities. At multiple steps we'll be making use of postman, our favorite API development environment. The example folder is the app in it's finished state with commented code.
